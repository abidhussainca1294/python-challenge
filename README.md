This repository contains basic Python programming solution for below two sets of data demonstrating the use of reading CSV, writing output text file, using aggregate functions and printing result to console.

1. PyBank : In this Challenge, we are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. A financial dataset called budget_data.csv has been provided.
   The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". 

2. PyPoll : In this Challenge, we are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. A set of poll data called election_data.csv has been provided.
   The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 


Using the two data sets multiple insignts have been derived. The result is printed on the console as well as written in a text file.
